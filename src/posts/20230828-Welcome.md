## yes

This blog is built using vue.js and tailwind.css.

I love clean code.

Instead of this

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mylist = []
for number in numbers:
    mylist.append(number+1)
```

I prefer this

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mylist = [number+1 for number in numbers]
```

this is code for js

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
function add(a, b){
    console.log(a+b)
}
```
